# Sudoku Solver
This is personal project to learn about algorithms used for solving sudokus.

The following paper introduced me to some of the possible approaches: https://www.csc.kth.se/utbildning/kandidatexjobb/datateknik/2012/rapport/berggren_patrik_OCH_nilsson_david_K12011.pdf

In my project, you will find a sudoku builder (or generator) and sudoku solver. To run the project you need to run main.py. I used Python 3.11.

For now, I am only uing brute force (backtracking), but I intend using other techniques (e.g. rule based) in the near future.

These are some ways I can improve the project:
- Only generate sudokus that have unique solutions
- Half of the time, the solver is not able to solve the sudoku (I will debug this when I will have the time)
- Add a more user friendly interface
